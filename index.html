								<h3>second week of blog devving</h3>
								<h4>its going to be a long one</h4>
								<p>w: 2023-10-06</p>

								Honestly i didnt have a ton of developments this week, work was busy and i was barely able to speak all week long, at least i
								got to watch some neat presentations from UFU's tech week, one was on marketing, quite eye opening how disney world treats the
								visitors and how they operate on a very calculated way to keep up the magic. <br />
							</p>
							<p>
								Another talk that was quite memorable was one about women in programming, the speakers all went abroad to study for 6-10 months
								in France, the US and Spain under the "science with no frontiers" program. They told how the culture of each country was, the
								work they did and since they were women, they still faced challenges due to their gender.
							</p>
							<p>
								I'm glad more and more women are getting into programming and computer related tasks and hobbies in general, there was never
								really a reason they shouldn't be part of this culture, even more so because the profession of a computer, person who did math
								for companies, was a mostly female profession, with a lot of ealy computer research being done by women
