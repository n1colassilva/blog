# Style guide

this will be filled as i go, for now:

- Classes go each on their own file

- Naming
    Honestly if you follow pip you'll be good
    1. Variables:
        Variables will be named in pascalCase.
    2. Functions:
        Functions will be named in pascalCase.
    3. Classes:
        I do not know the fancy name but name them LikeThis (pascal but first letter is capitalized).
    4. Files:
        No capitalization, use underlines instead of spaces
    5. Directories:
        Same as files, try to keep them one worded

- Comments
    Use jsdoc for the love of god, no i don't care if you think it's ugly, it works well;

    use multi line comments *except when in same line comments*;

    regarding same line comments, keep them short;

    comment,document, but don't over do it.

- Paragraphs
    Remember what i said about pip?
    2 lines after functions
    2 lines after classes
    2 lines after objects

remember that these are more guidelines than anything

- Hungarian notation
    NO.
